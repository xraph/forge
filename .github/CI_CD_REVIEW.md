# CI/CD Review for Forge Framework
**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Dr. Ruby  
**Focus**: Package Release & CLI Release with Conventional Commits

---

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Core infrastructure exists but has critical gaps

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ Conventional commits validation is well-implemented
- ‚úÖ Package release workflow exists
- ‚úÖ GoReleaser configuration is comprehensive
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Missing actual CLI release workflow (release.yml appears corrupted)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some configuration inconsistencies need addressing

---

## 1. Conventional Commits Implementation

### ‚úÖ PR Validation (`pr-conventional-commits.yml`)

**Strengths**:
- Validates both PR title and individual commits
- Provides clear feedback via PR comments
- Sets status checks for branch protection
- Analyzes release impact (major/minor/patch)
- Auto-labels PRs based on commit type
- Includes helpful guidelines in comments

**Score**: 9/10

**Minor Improvements**:
```yaml
# Consider adding support for custom commit types
# Consider caching npm dependencies for faster runs
```

### ‚úÖ Release Preparation (`conventional-commits.yml`)

**Strengths**:
- Creates/updates release PRs automatically
- Prevents duplicate release PRs
- Auto-merge capability
- Generates changelog
- Creates version tags automatically

**Issues Found**:
1. **Version file location**: Uses `.github/version.json` - consider root level for visibility
2. **Auto-merge safety**: No requirement for approval or passing checks before auto-merge
3. **Changelog generation**: Uses external action (TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action@v3)

**Score**: 7/10

**Recommended Changes**:
```yaml
# Add check for required reviewers
# Add wait for status checks before auto-merge
# Consider using native Go tooling for changelog generation
```

---

## 2. Package Release Workflow

### ‚úÖ Package Release (`package-release.yml`)

**Strengths**:
- Tests across multiple Go versions (1.21, 1.22, 1.23)
- Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Validates examples
- Checks backwards compatibility
- Generates documentation
- Notifies Go proxy

**Critical Issues**:

#### üö® Issue #1: Go Version Mismatch
```yaml
# package-release.yml uses:
go-version: ['1.21', '1.22', '1.23']

# But go.mod requires:
go 1.24.0
```

**Impact**: CI tests on wrong Go versions  
**Fix Required**: Update workflow to test on 1.24

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #2: Test Exclusions
```yaml
# Makefile excludes bk/ directory:
TEST_DIRS := $(shell go list ./... 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/bk/')

# But package-release.yml runs:
go test -v -race ./...  # Tests everything including bk/
```

**Impact**: Inconsistent test coverage  
**Fix Required**: Align test commands

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #3: Missing Dry-Run
No dry-run or staging environment testing before actual release.

**Score**: 6/10

---

## 3. CLI Release Workflow

### ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing/Corrupted CLI Release Workflow

**Problem**: The `release.yml` file appears to contain Dockerfile content instead of GitHub Actions workflow. This is a **CRITICAL BLOCKER**.

**Expected Content**: GoReleaser workflow that:
- Triggers on version tags (v*)
- Runs tests
- Builds multi-platform binaries
- Publishes to GitHub Releases
- Builds and pushes Docker images
- Updates package managers (Homebrew, Scoop, etc.)

**Current Content**: Dockerfile (wrong file content)

**Required Action**: Create proper `release.yml` workflow

---

## 4. GoReleaser Configuration

### ‚úÖ `.goreleaser.yml`

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Proper architecture support (amd64, arm64)
- Docker multi-arch support
- Package manager integrations (Homebrew, Scoop, Snap, AUR, DEB/RPM)
- Conventional commit changelog grouping
- Proper ldflags for version info

**Issues**:

#### Issue #1: Missing Release Workflow Integration
GoReleaser config exists but no workflow to execute it.

#### Issue #2: Placeholder Information
```yaml
maintainers:
  - 'Your Name <your.email@example.com>'  # Needs real maintainer info
```

#### Issue #3: Optional Environment Variables
```yaml
# These are defined but may not exist:
- FURY_TOKEN        # For fury.io publishing
- AUR_KEY           # For AUR publishing
- Discord webhook   # For announcements
- Slack webhook     # For announcements
- Twitter          # For announcements
```

**Recommendation**: Add documentation for which env vars are required vs optional

**Score**: 8/10

---

## 5. Supporting Workflows

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Go CI Workflow (`go.yml`)

**Issues**:
1. Uses outdated actions (checkout@v3, setup-go@v4)
2. Hardcoded Go version "1.24" doesn't match go.mod "1.24.0"
3. Linting is commented out
4. Only runs basic build and test
5. Excludes bk/ directory (inconsistent with package-release.yml)

**Recommended Enhancement**:
```yaml
name: Go CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version-file: go.mod  # Use go.mod version
          check-latest: true
      
      - name: Cache Go modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/go/pkg/mod
            ~/.cache/go-build
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
      
      - name: Verify dependencies
        run: |
          go mod verify
          go mod tidy
          git diff --exit-code go.mod go.sum
      
      - name: Run tests (exclude bk/)
        run: |
          go test -v -race -timeout=5m $(go list ./... | grep -v '/bk/')
      
      - name: Run linter
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3
        with:
          version: latest
          args: --timeout=5m
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NPM Publish Workflow (`npm-publish.yml`)

**Issues**:
1. Uses outdated actions
2. Hardcoded Node version (18, current LTS is 20)
3. No validation before publish
4. No rollback mechanism
5. References `frontend/` directory which appears empty in project layout

**Question for User**: Is frontend package publishing still needed? The `frontend/` directory appears unused.

## 6. Critical Gaps & Missing Components

### üö® Critical (Must Fix)

1. **Missing CLI Release Workflow**
   - Create proper `release.yml` to trigger GoReleaser
   - Integrate with version tags
   - Add comprehensive testing before release

2. **Go Version Inconsistencies**
   - Align all workflows with go.mod version
   - Use `go-version-file: go.mod` consistently

3. **Test Directory Inconsistencies**
   - Decide on bk/ directory handling
   - Document exclusions
   - Make all workflows consistent

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority (Should Fix)

4. **Missing Secrets Documentation**
   - Document required vs optional secrets

10. **Documentation Automation**
    - Auto-generate release notes
    - Update documentation site
    - Notify user community

---

## 7. Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)

**Priority 1: Create CLI Release Workflow**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release CLI

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  prepare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.tag }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Validate tag
        id: tag
        run: |
          TAG=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}
          if [[ ! "$TAG" =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?$ ]]; then
            echo "Invalid tag format: $TAG"
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "tag=$TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  test:
    needs: prepare
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version-file: go.mod
          check-latest: true
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: make test
      
      - name: Run linter
        run: make lint

  release:
    needs: [prepare, test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version-file: go.mod
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      
      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Run GoReleaser
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v5
        with:
          version: latest
          args: release --clean
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FURY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FURY_TOKEN }}
          AUR_KEY: ${{ secrets.AUR_KEY }}
      
      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: release-artifacts
          path: dist/*
```

**Priority 2: Fix Go Version Inconsistencies**
- Update all workflows to use `go-version-file: go.mod`
- Remove hardcoded versions
- Add version check to CI

**Priority 3: Standardize Test Commands**
- Document bk/ exclusion reason
- Make all workflows use same test command
- Update Makefile if needed

### Phase 2: High Priority Improvements (Week 2)

**Priority 4: Add Secrets Documentation**
```markdown
# .github/SECRETS.md
# Required Secrets Configuration

## Required (CI/CD will fail without these)
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Optional (Enhance functionality)
- NPM_TOKEN: For npm package publishing
- FURY_TOKEN: For fury.io package distribution
- AUR_KEY: For Arch Linux AUR publishing
- DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: For Discord release notifications
- SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: For Slack release notifications
```

**Priority 5: Add Pre-Release Testing**
```yaml
# Add to conventional-commits.yml
- name: Dry-run release
  run: |
    # Test release process without publishing
    goreleaser check
    goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

**Priority 6: Add Version Validation**
```yaml
# Add to all workflows
- name: Validate version consistency
  run: |
    WORKFLOW_VERSION="${{ matrix.go-version }}"
    MOD_VERSION=$(grep "^go " go.mod | cut -d' ' -f2)
    if [ "$WORKFLOW_VERSION" != "$MOD_VERSION" ]; then
      echo "Version mismatch: workflow=$WORKFLOW_VERSION mod=$MOD_VERSION"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Phase 3: Polish & Documentation (Week 3)

**Priority 7: Comprehensive Documentation**
- Update RELEASE.md with actual process
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Document all environment variables
- Create runbook for release issues

**Priority 8: Monitoring & Alerts**
- Add workflow status badges to README
- Set up failure notifications
- Track release metrics

## 8. Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Good Security Practices

1. Uses least-privilege permissions
2. Docker images run as non-root user
3. Binaries are stripped and signed
4. Checksums generated for artifacts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Concerns

1. **Auto-merge without approval**
   - Release PRs auto-merge without human review
   - **Recommendation**: Require approval for release PRs

2. **No artifact signing verification**
   - Artifacts are generated but signing not enforced
   - **Recommendation**: Add GPG signing

3. **Secrets exposure**
   - Multiple optional secrets not documented
   - **Recommendation**: Use environment-specific secrets

4. **Dependency supply chain**
   - No verification of downloaded dependencies
   - **Recommendation**: Add `go mod verify` to all workflows

---

## 9. Performance Considerations

### Current Performance Issues

1. **No caching in package-release.yml**
   - Go modules downloaded fresh every time
   - **Impact**: Slower CI runs, higher cost

2. **Sequential testing**
   - Go versions tested sequentially
   - **Improvement**: Use matrix parallelization

3. **Redundant builds**
   - Same code built multiple times across workflows
   - **Improvement**: Share artifacts between jobs

### Recommended Optimizations

```yaml
# Add to all workflows
- name: Cache Go modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/go/pkg/mod
      ~/.cache/go-build
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-go-

# Use matrix parallelization
strategy:
  matrix:
    go-version: ['1.24']
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
  fail-fast: false  # Continue other jobs if one fails
```
