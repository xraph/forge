## Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| Go | 1.21+ | Latest stable |
| OS | Linux, macOS, Windows | Any |

<Callout type="info">
Forge uses Go generics extensively for type-safe dependency injection. Go 1.21 or later is required.
</Callout>

## Install the Forge CLI

The Forge CLI (`forge`) is the primary tool for developing, building, and managing Forge applications. It provides hot-reload development servers, code generation, database migrations, and more.

<Tabs items={["Homebrew (macOS/Linux)", "Go Install", "Scoop (Windows)", "Binary Download", "Linux Packages", "Docker"]}>
<Tab value="Homebrew (macOS/Linux)">

The recommended way to install on macOS and Linux:

```bash
brew install xraph/tap/forge
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
brew upgrade xraph/tap/forge
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Go Install">

If you already have Go installed:

```bash
go install github.com/xraph/forge/cmd/forge@latest
```

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your `PATH`.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Scoop (Windows)">

Install using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

```bash
scoop bucket add xraph https://github.com/xraph/scoop-bucket
scoop install forge
```

To upgrade:

```bash
scoop update forge
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Binary Download">

Download the pre-built binary for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xraph/forge/releases) page.

1. Download the archive for your OS and architecture (e.g., `forge-x.x.x-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`)
2. Extract the binary:

```bash
tar -xzf forge-*.tar.gz
```

3. Move it to a directory in your `PATH`:

```bash
sudo mv forge /usr/local/bin/
```

4. Verify:

```bash
forge version
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Linux Packages">

Pre-built `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.apk`, and Arch Linux packages are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xraph/forge/releases) page.

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i forge_*.deb

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo rpm -i forge_*.rpm

# Alpine
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted forge_*.apk
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Docker">

The Forge CLI is also available as a Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/xraph/forge:latest
```

Run it:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/xraph/forge:latest version
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Verify the CLI

After installation, confirm the CLI is available:

```bash
forge version
```

You should see version, commit, and build information printed to the terminal.

## Add Forge to Your Project

Once the CLI is installed, set up Forge as a Go dependency in your project.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Initialize your Go module

If you are starting a new project, create a module first:

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
go mod init github.com/yourorg/my-project
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Add Forge as a dependency

```bash
go get github.com/xraph/forge@latest
```

This installs the core framework. Extensions are installed separately as needed:

```bash
# Examples of optional extensions
go get github.com/xraph/forge/extensions/database@latest
go get github.com/xraph/forge/extensions/kafka@latest
go get github.com/xraph/forge/extensions/grpc@latest
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify the library

Create a minimal `main.go` to confirm the library is working:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/xraph/forge"
)

func main() {
    app := forge.New(
        forge.WithAppName("install-check"),
    )
    fmt.Printf("Forge app created: %s\n", app.Name())
}
```

Run it using the Forge CLI:

```bash
forge dev
```

You should see the Forge startup banner with your application name and the address it is listening on.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Version Compatibility

Forge follows semantic versioning. The module path is `github.com/xraph/forge`.

When upgrading, always run:

```bash
go get github.com/xraph/forge@latest
go mod tidy
```

<Callout type="warn">
Extensions share the same version as the core framework. Keep them in sync to avoid compatibility issues.
</Callout>

## IDE Setup

### VS Code

Install the official [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) for full IntelliSense, debugging, and test support. Add these settings for the best experience:

```json
{
  "go.useLanguageServer": true,
  "gopls": {
    "ui.semanticTokens": true,
    "ui.completion.usePlaceholders": true
  }
}
```

### GoLand / IntelliJ

GoLand provides full support out of the box. Ensure the Go plugin is up to date and that the project SDK points to Go 1.21+.

### Neovim

Use `gopls` as the language server with your preferred LSP client (nvim-lspconfig, coc.nvim, or similar).

## Recommended Project Structure

Forge does not enforce a specific project layout, but the following structure works well for most applications:

```
my-project/
├── main.go                 # Application entry point
├── config.yaml             # Base configuration
├── config.local.yaml       # Local overrides (git-ignored)
├── .forge.yaml             # Forge CLI configuration (optional)
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── internal/
│   ├── handlers/           # HTTP handler functions
│   │   └── users.go
│   ├── services/           # Business logic
│   │   └── user_service.go
│   ├── models/             # Data models
│   │   └── user.go
│   └── middleware/          # Custom middleware
│       └── auth.go
└── extensions/             # Custom extensions (if any)
    └── notifications/
        └── extension.go
```

Key conventions:

- **`main.go`** creates the app, registers services and routes, and calls `app.Run()`.
- **`config.yaml`** is auto-discovered by Forge and loaded into the configuration manager.
- **`config.local.yaml`** provides developer-specific overrides and should be added to `.gitignore`.
- **`internal/`** keeps packages private to your module, following standard Go conventions.

## Configuration Files

Forge auto-discovers configuration files on startup. Place a `config.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
# config.yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  timeout: 30s

database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  name: myapp

logging:
  level: info
```

Create `config.local.yaml` for personal overrides (add this to `.gitignore`):

```yaml
# config.local.yaml - developer-specific overrides
database:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  password: localdev

logging:
  level: debug
```

See the [Configuration](/docs/forge/configuration) guide for full details on auto-discovery, environment variables, and config binding.
