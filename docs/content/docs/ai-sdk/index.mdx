The AI SDK is a standalone Go library for building production AI applications. It provides type-safe text generation, structured output via generics, agent orchestration, multi-tier memory, RAG pipelines, workflow engines, and native safety guardrails -- all built for Go's concurrency model with zero external dependencies for core features.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/xraph/ai-sdk
```

## Key Features

- **Type-safe generics** -- structured output with compile-time type checking
- **Multiple LLM providers** -- OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Azure, HuggingFace, LM Studio
- **Agent patterns** -- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) and Plan-Execute agents
- **Multi-tier memory** -- working, short-term, long-term, and episodic memory with automatic consolidation
- **RAG pipeline** -- document chunking, embedding, semantic search, and reranking
- **Workflow engine** -- DAG-based orchestration with parallel execution
- **Tool system** -- auto-discovery from Go functions with JSON schema validation
- **Native guardrails** -- zero-cost PII detection, toxicity filtering, and prompt injection prevention
- **Cost management** -- budget tracking, usage analytics, and optimization recommendations
- **Resilience** -- circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and rate limiting
- **Streaming** -- real-time token streaming with thinking/reasoning extraction
- **MCP support** -- Model Context Protocol client and server
- **17+ integrations** -- pgvector, Qdrant, Pinecone, Redis, PostgreSQL, and more
