## Overview

`github.com/xraph/forge/extensions/ai` is a Forge extension that wires core AI services into the container.

It is intentionally a thin wrapper around `github.com/xraph/ai-sdk` and focuses on DI registration, not a full platform bootstrap.

## What It Registers Automatically

- `aisdk.LLMManager` (with key aliases: `forge.ai.sdk.llmManager`, `forge.ai.llmManager`)
- `aisdk.StateStore`
- `aisdk.VectorStore`
- `*ai.AgentFactory`
- `*ai.AgentManager`
- Training interfaces only when `config.Training.Enabled == true`:
  - `ai.ModelTrainer`
  - `ai.DataManager`
  - `ai.PipelineManager`

## What It Does Not Auto-Register

- No automatic route mounting. You must register `AgentController` routes yourself.
- No automatic startup of inference engine, middleware, or monitoring packages.
- No automatic LLM provider registration from `config.LLM.Providers` (providers are currently registered manually).

## Important Runtime Notes

- State store creation falls back to in-memory store when configured backend creation fails.
- Vector store creation falls back to in-memory store when configured backend creation fails.
- Agent definitions are held in memory by `AgentManager`.
- Extension `Health()` currently returns `nil` and does not aggregate component checks.
