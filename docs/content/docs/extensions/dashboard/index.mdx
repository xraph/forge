## Overview

`github.com/xraph/forge/extensions/dashboard` provides an extensible micro-frontend dashboard shell for Forge applications. It is powered by ForgeUI and uses a **contributor-based architecture** where extensions register pages, widgets, and settings that are merged into a unified admin dashboard.

The dashboard supports both **local contributors** (in-process, rendering gomponents nodes) and **remote contributors** (separate HTTP services whose HTML fragments are proxied and embedded). Navigation, layout, and theming are handled automatically by the shell.

## What It Registers

| Service | DI Key | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard extension | `dashboard` | `*Extension` |

Routes are mounted on the Forge HTTP router during `Start()` at the configured base path (default `/dashboard`).

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "time"

    "github.com/xraph/forge"
    "github.com/xraph/forge/extensions/dashboard"
)

func main() {
    app := forge.New(
        forge.WithAppName("my-app"),
        forge.WithAppVersion("1.0.0"),
    )

    if err := app.RegisterExtension(dashboard.NewExtension(
        dashboard.WithTitle("My Dashboard"),
        dashboard.WithBasePath("/dashboard"),
        dashboard.WithRealtime(true),
        dashboard.WithRefreshInterval(30 * time.Second),
        dashboard.WithExport(true),
        dashboard.WithTheme("auto"),
    )); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to register dashboard: %v", err)
    }

    // Dashboard available at http://localhost:8080/dashboard
    if err := app.Run(); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("application error: %v", err)
    }
}
```

## Programmatic Access

Retrieve the dashboard extension from the DI container to access its subsystems:

```go
ext, _ := forge.InjectType[*dashboard.Extension](app.Container())

// Data collection
collector := ext.Collector()
overview := collector.CollectOverview(ctx)
health := collector.CollectHealth(ctx)
metrics := collector.CollectMetrics(ctx)

// Historical data
history := ext.History()
all := history.GetAll()

// Contributor registry
registry := ext.Registry()

// Bridge (Go-JS function calls)
bridge := ext.DashboardBridge()

// SSE real-time broker
broker := ext.SSEBroker()
```

## HTTP Endpoints

All routes are under the configured base path (default `/dashboard`):

## Key Concepts

- **Contributor System** -- extensions register pages, widgets, and settings via a manifest. Local contributors render gomponents; remote contributors serve HTML fragments over HTTP.
- **ForgeUI Shell** -- layouts (root, dashboard, base, full, settings), HTMX partial navigation, Alpine.js state management, and automatic sidebar construction from contributor manifests.
- **Go-JS Bridge** -- call Go functions from the browser via Alpine.js `$go()` magic helpers. 8 built-in dashboard functions plus custom function registration.
- **SSE Real-Time** -- server-sent events push metric, health, and contributor state updates to connected browsers.
- **Federated Search** -- contributors implementing `SearchableContributor` are searched in parallel across the entire dashboard.
- **Data Export** -- export metrics and health data in JSON, CSV, or Prometheus format.
