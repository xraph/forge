## Config Integration Pattern

Most extensions load configuration from one or both keys:

- `extensions.ai
auth
cache
consensus
cron
dashboard
database
discovery
events
features
gateway
graphql
grpc
hls
kafka
mcp
mqtt
orpc
queue
search
security
storage
streaming
webrtc` (preferred)
- `ai
auth
cache
consensus
cron
dashboard
database
discovery
events
features
gateway
graphql
grpc
hls
kafka
mcp
mqtt
orpc
queue
search
security
storage
streaming
webrtc` (legacy compatibility)

Confirm exact key behavior in `extensions/ai
