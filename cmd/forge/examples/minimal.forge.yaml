# Minimal .forge.yaml - Covers 80% of projects
# This configuration uses smart defaults based on Go conventions

project:
  name: "my-project"
  module: "github.com/myorg/my-project"

database:
  driver: "postgres"
  connections:
    dev:
      url: "postgres://localhost:5432/mydb_dev?sslmode=disable"
    production:
      url: "${DATABASE_URL}"

# That's it! Everything else uses smart defaults:
# - Project structure: Go conventions (cmd/, apps/, pkg/, internal/)
# - Build: Auto-discovers apps in cmd/
# - Dev: Auto-discovers and watches Go files
# - Migrations: ./database/migrations
# - Seeds: ./database/seeds
# - Output: ./bin
